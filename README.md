# QuickSheet

QuickSheet is a lightweight and handy cheat sheet viewer for Windows Desktop. 

I like having many cheat sheets available when I work, so the app was created to address my own needs. It is possible that others might also find it useful and I will be very happy to add more features on request whenever I have time. So if you have some cool ideas or found some issues, feel free to report it here on GitHub.

### Getting started

If you'd like to give QuickSheet a go, the best way to start is to download installer from the project page [here](www.emilborowiec.com/quicksheet). The installer will get you started with few sample quicksheet files you can modify or use as markup reference. On the page you'll also find keyboard shortcuts, features, explanation of markup and more downloadable samples.

### Building it

To build QuickSheet you will need .NET Core SDK 3.1.x.

### Contributing

The project is written in C#, based on WPF and the code follows MVVM approach. If you'd like to contribute go ahead and drop me a message.
