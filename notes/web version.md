# Cheat Sheet Viewer Web

## Problem definition

I do like using cheat sheets as a quick reference. In my line of work there is a lot of small recipes to remember. I have created desktop app for cheat sheets, but synchronizing my cheat sheet files across computers quickly became a problem. 

Obvious solution to this problem is to create an online version of cheat sheet viewer. All my cheat sheets on a single browser tab. Not bad. 

Hmm. Actually cheat sheet is a form of usable note. And I have also wanted to solve a problem of organizing notes for complex domains. I see that many of the requirements related to managing user's content allowing to share it with other users are very similar here. I could create one system that will serve for technical note taking etc.
